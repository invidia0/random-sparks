Ciao! ✌️

I'm Mattia, a Doctoral student at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy.

My research mainly focuses on multi-robot systems, but I’m also working on probabilistic machine learning fundamentals and curious about the world of deep learning (where I still have plenty to learn!).

I created this blog as a space to share ideas and concepts in the way I wish they had been explained to me. By doing so, I hope not only to pass on knowledge but also to deepen my own understanding. Expect a mix of theory and hands-on explorations.
